### 4.1 NetworkManager
- NetworkManager is installed.
- But it won't connect to WiFi directly on startup
- You can use the NetworkManager tools like `nmcli` and `nmtui` tools to connect to a WiFi network, but this needs to be done on every system startup.
- Automate this process by enabling the NetworkManager daemon using:
	- `sudo systemctl enable NetworkManager.service --now`
- And once this is started then connect to wifi once using `nmcli` or `nmtui`, then you're done, on every  system startup it'll do this for us
- I want only NetworkManager to handle my connections stuff, so I'll disable all other daemons which might be doing networking shit like:
	- `iwd`
	- `dhcpd`
	- `wpa_supplicant`
using: `sudo systemctl disable <service name> --now`
- NOTE: for me `wpa_supplicant` was the only one pre-installed and running. and apparently it's needed by NetworkManager so I won't be disabling it.


### 4.2 Keyboard Backlighting
- Currently my RGB lights are being turned off on system boot
- This is because the value in the file `/sys/class/leds/asus::kbd_backlight/brightness` is being set to `0`. The `/sys/class/leds/asus::kbd_backlight/max_brightness` has a value of `3`, so simply echo-ing `3` into the file `/sys/class/leds/asus::kbd_backlight/brightness` is working fine. And also on reboot the value persists, so further troubleshooting needed for now

OPTIONAL FURTHER TROUBLESHOOTING
If problem still persists
1. `echo` `3` into that same file again
	- use `sudo systemd-backlight save leds:asus::kbd_backlight`
	- reboot and check

2. The `leds:asus::kbd_backlight.service` daemon is managing the keyboard backlights. Try to disable this using
	- `sudo systemctl disable system backlight@leds:asus::kbd_backlight.service`
	- and reboot to see if default keyboard firmware works, if yes this  daemon was interfering for no reason
3. Download packages like `openrgb`, `rog-control-center`, `asusctl` and try further with those tools.
