The goal is to be able to program any microprocessor/controller attached to  a breadboard, for that we first need to be able to store a program on a memory device.

So we'll create a "program flasher" using an arduino, therefore we need the arduino basics.


### 1.1 Basic Packages
Packages needed for development on an arduino are:

| Package        | Role               | Key Use                             |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `avr-gcc`      | Compiler           | Converts C/C++ to AVR machine code  |
| `avr-libc`     | Standard C library | Provides functions, I/O, delays     |
| `avr-binutils` | Binary utilities   | Assembling, linking, hex generation |
| `avrdude`      | Uploader/flasher   | Uploads code to microcontroller     |

Also installed arduino ide just in case.
