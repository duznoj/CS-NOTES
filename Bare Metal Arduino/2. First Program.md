Blinking an LED is the "Hello World" of embedded systems.

Connected an LED to pin 10 of arduino.

Arduino has 2 main functions.
- `void setup()`: this set's up the pins and their data flow directions input/output.
- `void loop()`: This will loop infinitely and keep execting.

#### Step 1:
Setup pin 10 to be output.
