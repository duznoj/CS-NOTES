Each process in Linux has 3 main files for i/o by default

1. `STDIN` is by default connected to the keyboard, has file descriptor number = `0`
2. `STDOUT` is by default connected to the monitor, has file descriptor number = `1`
3. `STDERR` is by default connected to the monitor as well, has file descriptor number = `2`

I/O redirections are used to write content to other places/files instead of their regular locations like STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR

There are two types of redirections? not really but idk how else to put it.

1. The arrow redirections `>, <, >>, <<`
2. The pipe redirection `|`

#### 2.1 Arrow redirections

##### 2.1.1 Output redirection

The general syntax is:
```bash
$ command [<fd_number>]\><some_location>
```

`<fd_number>` is optional, any file descriptor number can be put here, and anything written to that file descriptor number will be redirected to the location, by default `<fd_number>` is `1` for `STDOUT`

```bash
$ command > fileName
```

is equivalent to

```bash
$ command 1> fileName
```

- The location can either be a filename, if the filename doesn't exist, it will be created
- The location can also be another file descriptor, it has to be given with an ampersand `&`
- If the location is an `fd` number, it HAS to be given without space after the `>` operator, otherwise the `fd` number will be interpreted as a file name by bash

```bash
$ cat ~/.bashrc 1>&3
```

means, cat contents of `~/.bashrc`, but content should be redirected to whatever file file descriptor 3 is pointing to


- Multiple redirections can also be given like this:
```bash
$ <command> > file 2>&1
```
- Above command means "Redirect `STDOUT` to `file`, and also redirect `STDERR` to wherever `STDOUT` is pointing", which means both `STDOUT` and `STDERR` will write to `file`


##### 2.1.2 Input redirection

Similarly, to redirect contents being read from `STDIN`, use `<`

```bash
$ command [<fd_number>]\<<some_location>
```

`fd_number` is optional and is by default `0` for `STDIN`

The above command means "When reading into `<fd_number>`, read contents from `<some_location>`".

##### 2.1.3 Double Arrows

- The single arrow `> or <` overwrite the entire contents of the file, not just the first n characters written
```bash
$ cat <filename>
123456890
$ echo "ab" > <filename>
$ cat <filename>
ab
# NOT ab34567890
```

- The double arrow output `>>` redirection perform redirection in append mode
```bash
$ cat <filename>
123456890
$ echo "ab" >> <filename>
$ cat <filename>
1234567890ab
```


##### 2.1.4 Misc

- There are `<<` and `<<<` operators called Here-Documents and Here-Texts respectively, study them later.


- Example:
`ls <dir which exists>` will write to `STDOUT`
`ls <dir which does not exist>` will write to `STDERR`

`ls /etc /urmom 2> some_file`
will write the output of `/etc` to the terminal, but will redirect the error message of `/urmom` to the file instead of terminal.
#### 2.2 Pipe

- The `|` operator is used to connect `STDOUT` of one process to `STDIN` of another process

```bash
$ command1 | command2
```

- Both commands execute in parallel
- If command2 reaches a read from `STDIN`, it waits till it gets something from command1
- Only when command1 writes something to `STDOUT`, command2 reads that same thing on `STDIN` and continues
