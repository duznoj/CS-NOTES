- Bash maintains a history of the commands you execute in the `~/.bash_history` file
On Arch Linux by default is saves last 500 commands

- The number of commands saved can be changed using bash shell environment variables like `HISTSIZE` and `HISTFILESIZE`

- The `history` command will print out the commands saved in the bash history

In the bash prompt:
```bash
$ !<some text>
```
will execute the last/latest command which begins with `<some text>`



 To execute the `<number>th` command from the bash history, `1` being oldest. `n` being nth from the oldest.
```bash
$ !<number>
```



To delete the command from history at `<number>th` position (useful in case you typed in sensitive things like passwords into plain text in prompt)
```bash
$ history -d <number>
```


- The history of the current terminal session is not updated to the `~/.bash_history` file immediately when a command is executed, it is written to the file when the terminal session is closed.
- To clear the history of the current session use `history -c`
- To clear the contents of the `~/.bash_history` file, either do that manually, or use `history -w`


- Hit `ctrl-r` in bash, this will open up reverse search

```bash
$ (reverse-i-search)`<the text you type>': <the text it matches to>
```

- Now start typing in the command, bash will try to match up the text you have written with any commands or their arguments in the bash history.
- Hitting `ctrl-r` again with some text written in will take you to the next previous command which matches that text.
e.g:

```bash
$ history
cd abc
ls
grep "urmom" file.txt
cd /etc
```

Now hit `ctrl-r`

```bash
$ (reverse-i-search)`cd': cd /etc
```

Hitting `ctrl-r` again:

```bash
$ (reverse-i-search)`cd': cd abc
```


To navigate 1 command at a time (works in both reverse search and normal prompt):
- `ctrl-p` takes you to the previous command in history from the current one you navigated on to.
- `ctrl-u` takes you to the next command in history from the current one you navigated on to.
