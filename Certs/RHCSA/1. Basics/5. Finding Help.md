- Most commands/tools on linux have implemented a `--help` or `-h` command line argument/flag/option to print out a help message to find out how a command works, and any options it provides to change it's behavior.

#### 5.1 Using `man` commands

- `man` is a command which displays a manual page for a command if the developer of that command made one, and if it is there in the `mandb` (manual database).

The syntax to get `man` pages for a command is:
```bash
$ man <command name>
```

- The `-k` or `--apropos` option makes it such that instead of retrieving the exact man page for the command, it looks up the summary pages of all commands containing the search string, and now you can run `man` on the exact command you want


e.g: i know there is a function in `libopenssl` to open an `SSL` context, but i do not know the exact name, `man` requires you to provide exact entry name to retrieve the manual page.
So first look for appropriate pages using `man -k`
```bash
$ man -k open | grep "context"
OSSL_LIB_CTX (3ssl)  - OpenSSL library context
OSSL_LIB_CTX_free (3ssl) - OpenSSL library context
OSSL_LIB_CTX_get0_global_default (3ssl) - OpenSSL library context
OSSL_LIB_CTX_get_data (3ssl) - OpenSSL library context
OSSL_LIB_CTX_load_config (3ssl) - OpenSSL library context
OSSL_LIB_CTX_new (3ssl) - OpenSSL library context
OSSL_LIB_CTX_new_child (3ssl) - OpenSSL library context
OSSL_LIB_CTX_new_from_dispatch (3ssl) - OpenSSL library context
OSSL_LIB_CTX_set0_default (3ssl) - OpenSSL library context
```
now to get exact `man` page do:
```bash
$ man OSSL_LIB_CTX
```


#### 5.2 Updating `mandb`

- To update the `man` pages database, execute the `mandb` command as root.



#### 5.3 Other ways of finding help

- `man` pages are short, concise, and to the point, and is to be used for quick reference
- The `info` command provides a detailed user manual for the command which is more comprehensive with hierarchical structure with chapters and hyperlinks.
- The `pinfo` command works the same as `info`, but is better looking with colored text and stuff
- The `/usr/share/doc` directory contains additional documents associated with the command like `READMEs`, `Licesnses`, `changelogs`, etc.
