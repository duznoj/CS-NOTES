- When your'e not sure about the exact name for the filename, or want to execute a command with multiple files as it's arguments which match a pattern.

- e.g: If a directory has multiple different types of files like `.txt` and `.jpeg` and `.c`, but you only want to list out the `.txt` files, instead of manually typing out the filenames like this:
```bash
$ ls file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```

- Use the `*` wildcard like this:

```bash
$ ls *.txt
```

#### 7.1 Wildcards

- Wildcards are special characters used as placeholders in strings and used in pattern matching. Sort of like BNF/EBNF syntax
- By default `bash` supports the following wildcards:

1. `*`: Matches any string with 0 or more characters
	- e.g: `test*` matches to `test`, `testa`, `testabcsabsd`, `test12#%`.... (all possible strings beginning with `test`)

2. `?`: Matches any single character.
	- e.g: `ab?cd` matches `abacd`, `abbcd`, ....... so on, only a single character replaced by the `?` matches. And it won't match against an empty character, in this example it won't match `abcd`

3. `[]`: This matches a single character from a list of characters, this character list can be given manually or as a range.
	- e.g: `ab[xyz]d` matches `abxd`, `abyd`, `abzd`
	- The ranges can be given as: `[a-zA-Z0-9]`, or any subset of these
	- To match against any character NOT within the list, prefix the list with a `!`
	- e.g: `[!<list>]`.


##### 7.1.1 Wildcards overview

- Asterisk `*` Patterns
```
*.txt    # all files ending with .txt
report*  # all files starting with "report"
*2024*   # all files containing "2024" anywhere
*        # all files (including hidden files in some shells)
```


- Question Mark `?` Patterns
```
file?.txt     # file1.txt, fileA.txt, file_.txt
image?.jpg    # image1.jpg, imageA.jpg, image-.jpg
???.txt       # any 3-character filename with .txt extension
```


- Bracket `[]` Patterns
```
[abc]        # matches a, b, or c
[a-z]        # matches any lowercase letter
[0-9]        # matches any digit
[a-zA-Z]     # matches any letter
[!0-9]       # matches any character EXCEPT digits

# Character ranges
ls file[0-9].txt          # file0.txt to file9.txt
ls [a-z]*.txt             # Files starting with lowercase letters
ls [A-Z]*.log             # Files starting with uppercase letters

# Character sets
ls [aeiou]*.txt           # Files starting with vowels
ls [!0-9]*.txt            # Files NOT starting with digits

# Combined character classes
ls [a-zA-Z0-9]*.txt       # Alphanumeric starting characters
ls file[0-9][0-9].txt     # file00.txt to file99.txt

# Special character classes (in some shells)
ls [[:digit:]]*.txt       # Files starting with digits
ls [[:alpha:]]*.txt       # Files starting with letters
```

#### 7.2 Globbing

When the Linux Kernel receives a command via the `exec` systemcall, it cannot do this wildcard expansion, this wildcard expansion is already done by the bash shell, and it gives the kernel a command in plain string with all the wildcard expands. This wildcard expansion by the shell is called `Globbing`.

Globbing Process
```
User Input: ls *.txt
        ↓
Shell Parsing & Tokenization
        ↓
Pattern Recognition (*.txt identified as glob pattern)
        ↓
Filesystem Scan (read directory contents)
        ↓
Pattern Matching (apply *.txt to all filenames)  
        ↓
Expansion (replace *.txt with matched filenames)
        ↓
Command Execution: ls file1.txt file2.txt notes.txt
```
