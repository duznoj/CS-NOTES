#### 8.1 Filepaths - Absolute vs Relative

- An absolute file path is a complete reference to the file/directory you want to work with, an absolute path will always refer to the same path no matter where you are in your filesystem tree, it has the complete pathname starting with the root directory `/`
	- e.g: `/home/duznoj/Programming/`

- A relative filepath is an incomplete path which only contains the steps/path needed to get from the current directory to the target file/directory. A relative filepath either starts with the name of the next entity you want to go to, or a `.` which refers to the current directory, or a `..` which refers to the previous/one level up directory.
	- e.g `./include/SDL.h`


- It is best practice to end a path to a directory with an additional `/` at the end of the directory name, Linux commands will work without this as well, but if the directory doesn't exist, then commands will interpret that name as a filename and perform unexpected behaviour.
	- e.g `cp ./file1 ./dir1`, if `dir1` exists AND is a directory, then a copy of `file1` will be placed inside `dir1`, if `dir1` doesn't exist, then a file named `dir1` will be created and it will be copy of `file1`.
	- Instead if we used `cp ./file1 ./dir1/`, now the `cp` command will see if `dir1` is an existing directory, if yes, then will place a copy of `file1` inside `dir1`, else will give an error message saying `dir1` doesn't exist


TL;DR: use `<remaining path>/filename` for files and `<remaining path>/directory/` for directories.
