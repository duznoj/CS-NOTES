#### Address Bus:
- 8086 has a 20-Bit Address Bus => It can access up to $2^{20} = 1MiB$ of Memory
- An address that can be accessed by 8086 can be max of 5 [[1. BITS BITS BITS ITS ALL BITS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!#HEX DIGITS|Hex Digits]].
- Therefore, the range of Addresses goes from `0x00000` to `0xFFFFF`.
- And data in each address of of course 1 Byte, ranging from `0x00` to `0xFF`.

**NOTE**: Size of Address Bus shows how much memory can be accessed in totality, it does not have any reflection on the speed of the processor

#### Data Bus:
- 8086 has a 16-Bit Data Bus => in one cycle the $\mu P$  can access up to 2 Bytes of Data.

**NOTE**: Since the Data bus shows how much of data can be accessed/stored/manipulated at a time, it is directly correspondent/proportional to the speed of the $\mu P$.

Eg: 8085 had an 8-Bit Data Bus, therefore to do operations on a 16-Bit number, it required 2 cycles to read the 16-Bit number from memory, 1 cycle for lower 8-Bits and 1 cycle for higher 8-bits.

8086 will now get the entire 16-Bit number in 1 cycle, reducing the number of cycles required to do multi-byte operations by half, hence increasing the speed of the $\mu P$.

Simply put, you can finish the task quicker (transfer data), if your medium of transferring material (Data Bus) can carry more material (Data/Bytes) at a time.


**IMP**: These multi-byte values are fetched and stored from and to memory in [[1. BITS BITS BITS ITS ALL BITS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!#Endianness|Little Endian]] from.



#### Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):
- 8086 has a 16-Bit ALU
- => It can perform Arithmetic and Logic operations on up to 16-Bits at a time / in 1 instruction.
- Therefore 8086 is called a **16-Bit $\mu P$**.


#### Control Bus:

Every thing conceivable thing done by a CPU can be boiled down to these 4 operations:

1. Memory Read: CPU reads data from memory
2. Memory Write: CPU writes data to memory
3. IO Read: CPU reads data from an IO device
4. IO Write: CPU writes data to an IO device



8086 has many control signals. Some of the most important ones are:

1. <span style="text-decoration: overline;">RD</span> and <span style="text-decoration: overline;">WR</span>: Read Bar and Write Bar are 2 different signal lines which are active low.
		=> both can never be 0 together, the CPU will either read or write, but can't do both.	
		
If both of them are 1 => no data transfer from/to an external entity by the CPU is happening currently


2. M/<span style="text-decoration: overline;">IO</span>: A single signal to show whether the data being transferred is from a Memory Device or an IO device. M is active high and IO is active low.

#### System Bus
The collection of all: Address, Data and Control Buses is called the System Bus
