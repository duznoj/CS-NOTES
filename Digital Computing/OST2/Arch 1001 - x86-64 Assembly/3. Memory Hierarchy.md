![[Memory Hierarchy.png]]


### Registers:
Are the physical memory components ON the CPU, in which all data HAS to enter to get processed. i.e, all the songs you play, all the math you do on computers, everything at some point is taken into a register, some operation is done, on the data in the register, the result again exists in some register, and is later transferred where needed

The CPU can do operations on the data stored in registers VERY VERY quickly.
Registers are blazingly fast and hence very expensive.

Therefore, the amount of register memory available is very low.


### Caches:
Are also memory components present ON the CPU, they're also very fast, hence expensive, and in small quantities, but not as fast as registers.

### RAM:
A memory chip connected externally to the CPU, Memory access is fast, but not as fast as Register or Cache, since the CPU would have to request for data at a particular address in 1 T-state, then receive the data in another T-state, also, RAM and other chips are very slow compared to the CPU, that's why CPUs are extremely expensive and RAM is pretty cheap.


CONTENTS OF ALL ABOVE TYPES OF MEMORIES ARE LOST WHEN POWERED OFF

### Secondary Storage:
These devices are not meant for quick data access unlike the above types of memories.
These devices are meant for storing data for longer periods of time even when powered off.

Hence these are VERY SLOW, and inexpensive.
