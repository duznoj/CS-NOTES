- Downloaded `rustup` which is like a rust toolchain manager
- `rustc` is the rust-compiler
- `cargo` is a project manager/build tool for larger projects, avoid for now, learn later
- Rust program files have `.rs` file extension
- `// <comment>` for single line comments
- `/* <comment> */` for multi-line comments

`main` function is the entry point of the program and is written like this
```rust
fn main() {
}
```

To give output to command line `println!()` is used, the `!` means that `println!` is a macro

```rust
fn main() {
	println!("Hello World");
}
```

- `;` is necessary at the end of each statement
- Except for when you want to return the last expression as the return value for a function
```rust
// VALID
fn main() {
	println!("Hello World")
}

// VALID
fn main() {
	println!("Hello World");
}

// VALID
fn main() {
	println!("Hello World");
	println!("YO")
}

// INVALID
fn main() {
	println!("Hello World")
	println!("Yo");
}
```
