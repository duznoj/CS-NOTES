### 4.1 `if` Expression
- In rust, `if`/`else if`/`else` are expressions, and hence CAN return value
- General syntax is:
```rust
if <condition> {
	// if block
} else if <condition> {
	//else if-1 block 
} // else if ladder {

} else {
	
}

```
- Conditions need not be wrapped in parentheses, if done so, compiler will give unnecessary parentheses warning

- `if` as an expression, conditional assignment
```rust
let x = if <condition> { 69 } else { 420 };
```


- Rust does not have typical `switch-case`, it has `match` instead of `switch`, more on that later


### 4.2 Loops

Rust has 3 types of loops:
1. `loop`
2. `while`
3. `for`: (conditions apply)



#### 4.2.1 The `loop` loop

- `loop` is a keyword used to declare an infinite loop and can ONLY be explicitly exited using `break`
- Similar to `while(1) {}` in C
- Syntax is:
```rust
loop {
	// Body of the loop
}
```

- `loop` is the only type of loop which can be used as an expression, and be broken out of with a expression using: `break <expression>;`

```rust
let a = {
		let mut x = 0;
		loop {
			if x == 100 {
				break x;
			}
			
			x += 1;
		}
};
```


#### 4.2.2 The `while` loop

- Can only use `break;` to exit loop
- Cannot use `break <expresssion>;` to return an expression from the loop
- Hence, `while` is more like a statement than an expression

```rust
while <condition> {
	// Body of the loop
}
```


#### 4.2.3 The `for` loop
- Is a special type of loop.
- It is an "iterator based" loop.
- It is used to iterate over entities whose iterators can be made, i.e, entities which implement the `IntoIterator` trait.

Syntax:
```rust
for <variable_name> in <iterable_thing> {
	// Body of the loop
}
```

- Creating ranges `start..end` makes a range of `[start, end)`

```rust
for num in 0..10 {
 // 10 iterations, num goes from 0 to 9
}
```


#### 4.2.4 Loop Labels

- When `break` or `continue` is used, it is applied to the inner-most loop it was written in

- But if we want to apply break/continue to an outer loop from an inner-loop, then:
- Labels can be given to loops, and the break/continue can be given as:
- `break/continue <label_name>`
- Syntax to give labels to loops is:
```rust
'<label_name>: <regular loop (loop, while, for)>
```
- Note that the label name must start with a single quote `'`
- In case of breaking from a labelled `loop` loop while also returning an expression, use:
```rust
break '<label_name> <expression>;
```
