A commit is a snapshot of the repository at a given point in time. It's a way to save the state of the repository, and it's how Git keeps track of changes to the project. A commit comes with a message that describes the changes made in the commit.

The commit snapshots the previous state + any modifications added to the staging area using `git add`

Commit Syntax:
```bash
git commit -m "<commit-message>"
```

A commit must have a message, the beginning of the message is denoted by the `-m` flag

If in case you mess up the commit message you can fix it without having to delete the entire commit and possibly mess up anything else using:
```bash
git commit --amend -m "<new-message>"
```



To view the history of your repo, hit a `git log` this will show where you're currently at, what were the previous commits, etc.
```bash
git log
git [--no-pager] log [--one-line] [-n <number>] [--parents] [--graph]
```
The -n flag limits the number of commits to be shown, will show latest `<number>` of commits

The `--no-pager` flag will now open the `man` page style interface and will simply output the log to `stdout`.

The `git log` command shows who made the commit, when was the commit made, and what was changed.

Each commit has it's own unique `Commit Hash` which identifies a particular commit.

Example of a commit hash:
```
5ba786fcc93e8092831c01e71444b9baa2228a4f
```

Unless there's collision for it, git can work/identify hashes using only the first 7 characters of the hash, for the above example it is `5ba786f`.

`Commit Hashes` are derived from the changes made in content as well as:
- The commit message
- The author's name and email
- The date and time
- Parent (previous) commit hashes
git uses the `SHA-1` cryptographic algorithm to generate hashes.
