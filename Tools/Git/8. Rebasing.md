Suppose you have a repo in the state:
![[GIT BEFORE MERGE.png]]

Now if you want changes in the `other_branch` to be reflected in the main branch. There are 2 ways:
1. `git merge`, as we have seen earlier, this will create a new merge commit
2. `git rebase`

What `git rebase` does is to move the merge base of the `other_branch` to the tip of the branch you want to merge into, something like this:

![[rebasing-is-based.png]]

Now if you do a `git merge`, it will be a Fast-Forwarded merge. So it will be a clean integration with no additional merge commit created.

But don't be fooled thinking `B`, `C` and `D`, `E` can't have merge conflicts just because they aren't in parallel.

If there was originally going to be a merge conflict, it will still occur when/after rebasing.

Since after rebasing, The parents of the first commit of the rebased branch is changed, its SHA / hash will also change, and then consequently it's child's hash also changes, so on till the entire branch's commit's SHAs after the merge base are changed.

Rebasing is useful when working in a public repo with many contributors.

What you essentially do is:
1. Branch off from `main`, do your thing
	1. You could do your thing in your own branch locally over several commits
	2. You `squash`(squashing will be covered later) the several commits on your branch into the ones you like
2. While you were doing your thing, new commits might've been pushed to `main` by others, so you pull/fetch them locally before trying to merge in your branch
3. rebase your branch to the latest commit on main
4. merge into main
5. push your changes

This kind of workflow allows for easier reverts/resets to changes in the public repo.

Since rebasing a branch on another branch changes the hashes of the branch, you should never rebase a public branch, this will change the commit history of that branch for good for other people as well and it's not convenient. You always rebase your local branches on a public branch to get merge commit free merges.

 To `rebase` `other_branch` on to `main`, you `switch` to the branch you want to rebase. Then run:
 ```bash
 git rebase <target_branch>
```

This will do:
1. Replay all commits of the current branch on the target branch
2. The target branch still points to it's old tip/commit
3. The current branch is moved to point to the last of these replays.
Now you can safely merge current branch into the target branch.
